# Find Most Common Substring - 

Find the most common substring of length N given a string and a size N.
If multiple substrings tie for the most common, return only the first one in the list.

This was given to me as an interview question on Nov 14, 2017.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

argparse - for cli arguments
Otherwise, it is a stand alone program.

### Installing

Get a copy of the find_most_common_substring repository.


```
git clone https://github.com/king-md/find_most_common_substring.git
```

Copy the find_most_common_substring.py program to the directory where you want to run it from.

```
Windows: copy src\find_most_common_substring.py C:\DESTINATION

Linux: cp -p src/find_most_common_substring.py /home/user/bin/.
```


## Test Cases

input string "dogcatchcat"
input substring size "3"
